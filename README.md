# Telecom
This project aims to analyze customer engagement, experience, and satisfaction within a telecom company. By focusing on these key areas, we can derive insights that inform business strategies to improve customer retention, network performance, and overall satisfaction. The project also evaluates the company’s potential as a worthy investment or acquisition opportunity based on these factors.
Key Objectives
Engagement Analysis:

Analyze customer engagement metrics such as session frequency, data consumption, and popular applications.
Identify top power users and opportunities to increase engagement for moderate or low-engagement users.
Provide actionable insights for improving user engagement and increasing customer loyalty.
Experience Analysis:

Assess network performance, including throughput, latency, and retransmission volumes, across different customer segments and handset types.
Identify areas for optimizing network performance and improving user experience.
Analyze customer segments based on performance metrics to customize service improvements.
Satisfaction Analysis:

Measure customer satisfaction by analyzing engagement and experience scores.
Identify factors that contribute most to high satisfaction and areas requiring intervention.
Segment customers based on satisfaction levels and suggest tailored strategies to enhance satisfaction.
Investment Decision:

Gather insights to evaluate whether the telecom company is a viable investment based on customer engagement, experience, and satisfaction.
Provide data-driven recommendations on whether the company’s growth potential and customer loyalty justify acquisition or further investment.
